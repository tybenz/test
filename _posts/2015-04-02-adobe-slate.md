Today is super exciting for me. I've been working at Adobe for almost 4 years.
Since that time, I've never been able to work on an Adobe-branded product from
beginning to launch.

Today, my team at Adobe launched [Adobe Slate] [slate], one of the coolest iPad apps in
the world. Slate is all about creating something beautiful and inspiring,
without having to know anything about design. You give Slate your text and
imagery, and what you get out of it is a beautiful document that you can share
with anyone through the virtue of the Web.

It's been so much fun working on this project. I got a chance to contribute to
so many different parts of this thing&mdash;from the actual animations, to
themes, to the backend infrasructure. It's been a long-time coming, and I'm so
glad it's here.

Please go take a look at [Adobe Slate] [slate]. It's available today, for free, on the Apple App
Store.
