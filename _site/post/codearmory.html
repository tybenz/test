          <h1>Code Armory</h1>
          <p class="timestamp">September 18, 2012</p>
          <hr>

        <p>I&#39;ve been using Gists a lot recently to pass code back and forth between
myself and my co-workers, and I&#39;m starting to realize more and more how
valuable good code snippets can be. I find myself perusing Github all
the time to see what other people are working on and half the time I
stumble upon some small, reusable piece of code that I force myself to
grab and dump into my own little directory of code snippets.</p>

<p>The more and more I collect, the more I realize the process of finding
good code snippets on the web is pretty terrible. I often just hit
google and wind up on stack overflow, having to sift through a bunch of
people&#39;s ramblings and log files and whatnot. Why isn&#39;t there a better
place to search for these small bits of wonder-code?</p>

<p>I set out to see if it already existed, and it turns out that it
doesn&#39;t. So I plan on creating one.</p>

<h3>Side Story</h3>

<p>My sister-in-law went into labor last week so my wife and I
went down to Lemoore Naval Air Station to see the baby. As I was driving
off the base I saw a sign indicating which way to turn to get to the
Armory. That&#39;s when it hit me. This code snippet site need not only
focus on code snippets. I want to make it a place where developers get
equipped in every way they need.</p>

<h3>The Plan</h3>

<p>Offer the soldiers (developers) a chance to stock up on weapons
(snippets), load up on ammo (frameworks/libraries), engage in training
(walkthroughs) and choose their
barracks (development environments). The latter will most likely allow
for users to peruse various <a href="http://vagrantup.com">vagrant</a> boxes and
associated chef recipes (if you don&#39;t know about vagrant, get it).</p>

<h3>Implementation</h3>

<p>Like I said I love Gists. Rather than re-inventing the wheel
this new project is simply going to
leverage gists. I&#39;ll add some meta-data to various gists to create a place
where code snippets can be searched and saved more easily.</p>

<p>Why hasn&#39;t Github added this to Gist already? My bet is they&#39;ve been
busy. You know, redefining how everyone codes? They might
get around to improving Gist, but for now, I&#39;m taking it upon myself.
Who&#39;s with me?</p>

<h3>I Need Help</h3>

<p>I don&#39;t know about you, but this sounds like a dream to me. But I&#39;m
going to need help in getting some solid content onto this site. If you
can help spread the word, or send me some code snippets you&#39;ve found to
be invaluable, it would go a long way toward getting this project off
the ground.</p>
